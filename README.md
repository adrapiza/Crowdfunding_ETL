# Project 2 - Crowdfunding ETL

# Description
From the provided execel sheets provided, I extracted informtation to create dataframes. 

From the different dataframes, I was able to create four CSVs :
- Campaign (This includes selected information from the crowdfunding file provided)
- Contacts (Includes the id, names and their email addresses)
- Categories
- Subcategories

Using pgAdmin, I was able to create the tables and import the CSVs to their allocated table.
